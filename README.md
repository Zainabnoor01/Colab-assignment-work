# Programming for Data Analysis – Air Quality Coursework (CMP7005)

This repository contains all files developed for the **Programming for Data Analysis (CMP7005)** module coursework.  
The project investigates air pollution in India and addresses the research question:

**Which pollutants are most responsible for poor air quality (AQI) in India?**
Repository Contents
The repository includes the following components:
Google Colab notebooks for:
  - Importing and combining multiple CSV files  
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values and duplicates)  
  - Feature engineering for pollutant and date attributes  
  - Univariate analysis (histograms and distributions)  
  - Multivariate analysis (scatter plots and correlation analysis)  
  - Machine learning modelling (Random Forest and Ridge Regression)  

- app.py  
  - A multipage Streamlit application developed for **Task 4: Application Development**  
  - Includes:
    - Data Overview page  
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) page  
    - Modelling & Prediction page  

- Dataset files  
  - Combined and preprocessed air quality dataset used throughout the analysis  

Streamlit Application (Task 4)
A multipage Streamlit application was developed to integrate:
- Dataset overview  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Machine learning model results from Task 3  

Due to the temporary nature of Google Colab environments and public tunnelling services,  
screenshots of the application interface are provided in the submitted notebook to demonstrate functionality.

Version Control (Task 5)
GitHub was used for version control throughout the coursework to:
- To track development of notebooks and scripts  
- Record descriptive commit messages  
- Maintain an organised repository structure  

The commit history provides evidence of progressive development across all tasks.
