# Programming for Data Analysis - Air Quality Coursework
This repository contains my Google Colab notebooks for the **Programming for Data Analysis** module.  
The project focuses on exploring and preparing air pollution data through:

- Importing and combining multiple CSV files
- Data cleaning (handling missing values & duplicates)
- Feature engineering for pollutant and date attributes
- Univariate analysis (histograms & distributions)
- Multivariate analysis (scatter plot and bar chart)
- Streamlit
